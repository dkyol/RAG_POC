    "\n",
    "This notebook is playground for those interested in developing interactive web applications using LangChain and [**LangServe**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve). The aim is to provide a minimal-code example to illustrate the potential of LangChain in web application contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides a walkthrough for setting up a simple API server using LangChain's Runnable interfaces with FastAPI. The example demonstrates how to integrate a LangChain model, such as `ChatNVIDIA`, to create and distribute accessible API routes. Using this, you will be able to supply functionality to the frontend service's [**`frontend_server.py`**](frontend/frontend_server.py) session, which strongly expects:\n",
    "- A simple endpoint named `:9012/basic_chat` for the basic chatbot, exemplified below.\n",
    "- A pair of endpoints named `:9012/retriever` and `:9012/generator` for the RAG chatbot.\n",
    "- All three for the **Evaluate** utility, which will be required for the final assessment. *More on that later!*\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n",
    "- Make sure to click the square ( $\\square$ ) button twice to shut down an active FastAPI cell. The first time might fall through or trigger a try-catch routine on an asynchronous process.\n",
    "- If it still doesn't work, do a hard restart on this notebook by using **Kernel -> Restart Kernel**.\n",
    "- When a FastAPI server is running in your cell, expect the process to block up this notebook. Other notebooks should not be impacted by this. "

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate\\nknowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their\\nperformance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing\\nprovenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open\\nresearch problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to\\nexplicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been\\nonly investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose\\nfine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which\\ncombine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language\\ngeneration. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a\\npre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index\\nof Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG\\nformulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the\\nwhole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We\\nfine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP\\ntasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming\\nparametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures.\\nFor language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific,\\ndiverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq\\nbaseline.\\n\\nPage Body: .

However, their ability to precisely manipulate knowledge is limited, and they may not always provide provenance for their decisions or update their world knowledge accurately. In contrast, models like RAG, which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory, can access and manipulate knowledge more precisely, but their fine-tuning recipes are limited to extractive downstream tasks.\\n\\n Answer 2 (New): Pre-trained language models like BERT and models like R have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) by providing robust representations of language and enabling a range of downstream tasks. When it comes to the concepts of \"knowledge storage\" and \"knowledge access\", these models interact in the following ways:\\n\\n**Knowledge Storage:**\\n\\n1. **Weight Storage**: Pre-trained language models store knowledge in their weights, which are the parameters learned during training. These weights represent complex, latent concepts relationships in the data, such as language phenomena, styles, and domain-specific knowledge.\\n2. **Embedding Space**: Models like BERT and RAG store knowledge in the embedding space, where words, phrases, and tokens are mapped to dense vectors. These embeddings capture semantic relationships, contexts, and normalized language features.\\n3. **Contextualized Representations**: Pre-trained models store knowledge in the form of contextualized representations, which capture the interaction between the input context and word embeddings.

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate\\nknowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their\\nperformance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing\\nprovenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open\\nresearch problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to\\nexplicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been\\nonly investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose\\nfine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which\\ncombine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language\\ngeneration. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a\\npre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index\\nof Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG\\nformulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the\\nwhole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We\\nfine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP\\ntasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming\\nparametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures.\\nFor language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific,\\ndiverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq\\nbaseline.\\n\\nPage Body: .

This task forces the model to learn the context of the surrounding tokens, allowing it to generate more accurate representations.\\n\\n4. **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**: Another pre-training objective involves predicting whether two input sentences are adjacent in the original text. By training to distinguish between true and false pairs, BERT learns to capture long-range contextual relationships and has a better understanding of the input text.\\n\\n5. **Knowledge Graph-Basedualization**: When fine-tuning on downstream tasks, BERT can benefit from contextualization using knowledge graphs.

To address this, we explore using strong LLMs as\\njudges to evaluate these models on more open-ended questions. We examine the\\nusage and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge, including position, verbosity, and\\nself-enhancement biases, as well as limited reasoning ability, and propose\\nsolutions to mitigate some of them. We then verify the agreement between LLM\\njudges and human preferences by introducing two benchmarks: MT-bench, a\\nmulti-turn question set; and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform. Our\\nresults reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and\\ncrowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80% agreement, the same\\nlevel of agreement between humans. Hence, LLM-as-a-judge is a scalable and\\nexplainable way to approximate human preferences, which are otherwise very\\nexpensive to obtain. Additionally, we show our benchmark and traditional\\nbenchmarks complement each other by evaluating several variants of LLaMA and\\nVicuna.

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate\\nknowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their\\nperformance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing\\nprovenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open\\nresearch problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to\\nexplicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been\\nonly investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose\\nfine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which\\ncombine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language\\ngeneration. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a\\npre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index\\nof Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG\\nformulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the\\nwhole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We\\nfine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP\\ntasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming\\nparametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures.\\nFor language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific,\\ndiverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq\\nbaseline.\\n\\nPage Body: .

To address this, we explore using strong LLMs as\\njudges to evaluate these models on more open-ended questions. We examine the\\nusage and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge, including position, verbosity, and\\nself-enhancement biases, as well as limited reasoning ability, and propose\\nsolutions to mitigate some of them. We then verify the agreement between LLM\\njudges and human preferences by introducing two benchmarks: MT-bench, a\\nmulti-turn question set; and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform. Our\\nresults reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and\\ncrowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80% agreement, the same\\nlevel of agreement between humans. Hence, LLM-as-a-judge is a scalable and\\nexplainable way to approximate human preferences, which are otherwise very\\nexpensive to obtain. Additionally, we show our benchmark and traditional\\nbenchmarks complement each other by evaluating several variants of LLaMA and\\nVicuna.
